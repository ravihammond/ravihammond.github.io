I'm an aspiring Artificial Intelligence researcher specialising Robotics and Reinforcement Learning. Currently, I am a MSc student in Computer Science in the [Australian Institute for Machine Learning](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/){:target="\_blank"}at the [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/){:target="\_blank"}, supervised by [Prof. Ian Reid](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ATkNLcQAAAAJ){:target="\_blank"}. I've spent time interning as a Software Engineer at Google, Microsoft, Palantir Technoligies, and Atlassian.
